Introduction

This is a basic, fully functional solution to use as a web-based point-of-sale / virtual terminal for PayPal.  It is compatible with the following:

* PayPal Website Payments Pro 3.0 (DoDirectPayment)
* PayPal Payments Pro 1.5 / 2.0 (PayFlow Gateway)
* PayPal REST API

Using this instead of the PayPal provided Virtual Terminal will save you money on transaction fees (PayPal charges a higher rate for VT than they do for Pro transactions) and it also provides a simple swipe functionality that works with `USBSwiper credit card readers <https://www.usbswiper.com/usbswiper-usb-magnetic-stripe-credit-card-reader.html?utm_source=angelleye&utm_medium=paypal_pos&utm_campaign=github_readme>`_.
